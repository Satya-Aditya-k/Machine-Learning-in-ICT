intelligent plastic machines jump to navigation jump to search the world within us the word science comes from the latin word scientia meaning knowledge the practice of science is a search for the truth about reality scientific discoveries have created revolutions in our understanding of the reality of the world around us there have been within the experience of people now living at least three serious crises there have been two such crises in physics namely the conceptual soulsearching connected with the discovery of relativity and the conceptual difficulties connected with discoveries in quantum theory the third crisis was in mathematics it was a very serious conceptual crisis dealing with rigor and the proper way to carry out a correct mathematical proof in view of the earlier notions of the absolute rigor of mathematics it is surprising that such a thing could have happened and even more surprising that it could have happened in these latter days when miracles are not supposed to take place yet it did happen john von newman writing about godels incompleteness theorem ren descartess concept of the mind as a spirit which communicates with the brain via the eyes today we stand on the threshold of a revolution in our understanding of the reality of the world within us one that has been slowly creeping up over the horizon of our comprehension as discoveries in biochemistry botany microbiology medicine psychiatry psychology neuroscience and zoology shine new light upon the intricate mechanisms of all life including our own we are ordinarily completely unaware of what is really going on inside us for our eyes look outwards not inwards we experience our own thoughts and feelings but we cannot dissect and inspect them ourselves although we can dwell upon our imaginings by introspection and rumination but with knives and microscopes scientists can slice up other peoples heads and bodies and look inside them and what they have discovered is that contrary to what rene descartes thought all the evidence suggests that the mind is not situated outside the body in an ethereal metaphysical realm but in it in the real physical realm of substance there is no mindbrain duality what we call the mind is our conscious perception of processes occurring in the brain but the revelation doesnt stop there one of the newest kids on the block of evolution people have designed and manufactured some pretty amazing information processing machines only fairly recently the last years or so have we been able to use some of these machines to look deep inside the tissues of living organisms and start to really unravel the complexity of what they are made of and how they work and only very recently the last years or so have those investigations revealed that all living creatures are related to one another much more closely than ever before imagined what all living creatures have in common is what they are made of what they do and how they do it what they do is import things process them inside themselves to perform various functions including manufacturing new things from raw materials and export things these things light waves sound waves molecules and forces they are perturbations of the energy field of the universe they are information human cognitive processes such as sensations perceptions thoughts and feelings are physical processes they are information processes they are biocomputations anything that processes information in any kind of way is a computer plants as well as animals have senses and perform computational functions that process the inputs of their senses houseplant gardeners notice that they tend to grow towards the window where the light comes from this is no accident cells in a plants growing tip contain light sensors called phytochromes which initiate a cascade of biocomputations resulting in differential expansion of the cells lining its stem so that it takes on a curved shape plants can also sense the direction of gravity stems grow up whilst roots grow down from a seed no matter which way up the seed is phototropic plants cloned sheep ivf babies and all forms of life including you and me are information processors a contemporary version of descartes celebrated statement i think therefore i am might years later go something like this i live therefore i compute basic structure of an amino acid proteins are strings of amino acids linked by hydrogen bonds the computational mechanism of an artificial computing machine is mostly made of silicon and metals it represents its software program and data in the form of digital electrical signals its computations are performed by electronic mechanisms that operate on these signals the computational mechanism of a natural computing machine is mostly made of organic molecules called amino acids which are hydrocarbons that can link up to form long polymer chains called proteins a living machine represents its software in the form of chemical and electrical signals its computations are performed by organelles cells and organs that operate upon these signals and can be changed by them whereas an electronic computer can change its software but not as yet its hardware a living machine can modify the structures that perform its computations and even make new ones by computational processes we call growth and reproduction the physics of the bonds of proteins enables them to bend and twist into different shapes without destroying their chemical integrity the plasticity of proteins enables muscles to pulse skin to stretch and tendrils roots and neurons to grow towards light water and their neighbours just as silicon doesnt do much by itself neither do proteins but a complex assembly of proteins together with a few other kinds of molecules can do a remarkable thing it can change its physical structure the physical plasticity of proteins is one of the keys to the behavioural plasticity of organisms made of them the miraculous ability of living machines to manufacture their own componentry out of raw materials to grow reproduce and in response to the constantly changing flux of environmental conditions to intelligently adapt the physical structures that realise the material being of their computational functions octane a hydrocarbon found in crude oil black spheres are carbon white ones are hydrogen after death the natural polymers and other chemical components of living machines accumulate in the subsoil and by the processes of decomposition over long periods of time transmute into the constituents such as octane of coal and crude oil which can be dug up and reprocessed to produce synthetic polymers that which we call a rose when you do a web search you ask the search engine server farm to search its indexed database for matches input a keystring to it and it outputs a bunch of urls thats a computation in japan and india the traditional way of finding a spouse is to employ a matchmaker a person supposedly skilled at finding compatible partners matchmaking is a computation so the matchmaker is a computer when someone catches your eye or even more likely your vomero nasal organ is tickled by what it senses and you fancy them you are your own matchmaker you are the computer your information input is their beauty or pheremones and your information process your reaction places you in a new state of mind and body the concept of computation as a state transition was first proposed by turing although the idea of building a machine to perform computations dates back at least to the neolithic era for example stonehenge is a computer made of stone whose only moving parts are the sun and the moon stonehenge accurately computes the coincidence of the solar and lunar solstices hawkins when the coincidence occurs the apparatus of stonehenge changes as the two heavenly orbs appear framed by the viewfinder created by the angles and elevations of the henges when viewed from a particular spot there is more to stonehenge than a bunch of arches standing passively in a circle computers are processors of information stonehenge processes the information of the trajectories of the sun and moon across the sky across the seasons but what exactly is information when i use a word said humptydumpty in a scornful tone i use it to mean what i want it to mean neither more nor less lewis carrol through the lookingglass half answer information is something said or written that means something this is what most people would probably say and in one sense it is a perfectly reasonable operational definition but it is a purely subjective one as whether something means something to somebody depends completely upon the recipient for example an encrypted message seeks to conceal its meaning from all except those who know how to decrypt it yet the information in the encrypted message is still there its just that its indecipherable to those who dont know what computations they should do with the message to work out its meaning and the same principle is true of unencrypted messages in a language you dont understand because your brain hasnt learned to process it for example below is this paragraph written in swahili according to google na huyo wa kanuni ni kweli unencrypted ujumbe katika lugha huelewi sababu ubongo wako haina programu zinazohitajika mchakato yake kwa mfano chini ya aya hii imeandikwa katika kiswahili kulingana na google which is unintelligible to anyone who doesnt speak swahili but its not just foreign languages that can be indecipherable to us suppose you say something you believe to be deep and meaningful to someone and they reply thats nonsense to them what you said was devoid of information because they didnt have the same software as you in their heads yet to you it was a pearl of wisdom the information what you said as distinct from what you meant once spoken takes upon itself an existence independent of either you or them so to say that information is something that means something is only half the answer it really is something that would mean something if only you had the wit to understand it full answer information is distinctive variation in a physical field a signal that can be output transmitted input and processed we may be tempted to think of information as something abstract as something without a physical form because the same information can be represented by many different forms but information has no existence without a physical form to depict it whether that form is a sound wave ink on paper a tv signal a smell or a molecule of adrenaline circulating in someones bloodstream it is a physical form some examples of information fields are sound light the chemical landscape pressure and voltage the process of taking information in one form and producing the same information in another form is called transduction microphones loudspeakers and modems are examples of engineered transducers in describing the actions of biological cells signal transduction is the general term used to describe the response by a cell to a stimulus received from its environment this stimulus could be a chemical messenger or other forms of information such as heat salinity etc the information content of a signal can only be discerned from the general hubbub of white noise in the background field if the recipient has some mechanism for noticing it whether they understand it or not is another matter the discernment of a signal requires it to be different from the background in a distinctive way think of a cyclic sound like the sound of your own breathing only when it changes its rhythm or pitch or amplitude do you notice it samuel morses colleague alfred vail realised that message encoding could be done most efficiently if the most likely message constituents were encoded signalled with the shortest distinct signatures we all know this intuitively as in when we say ouch to urgently attract someones aidsympathy rather than embark upon a long discourse as to the nature of our request for help and when we write in dark ink on light paper or viceversa a purposeful sender of information intends it to have a certain meaning but the information itself has an existence independent of that intention and information can come in forms other than words for example a smell or a picture or a tap on the shoulder or a flutter of the eyelids a blush in the cheeks a gleam in the eye a tremble of the knee a bead of perspiration on the upper lip or a smile a grimace a wave a turn of the head a rustle in the undergrowth a dark cloud on the horizon a tiger sneaking up on its prey tries hard not to transmit information about its presence but if it steps on a twig that snaps with a sharp cracking sound all the animals and birds within earshot will bolt for cover at other times that same tiger will deliberately announce its presence not to prey but to other tigers to lay claim to a territory by leaving chemical messages in their urine all over the place they will even urinate right on top of another tigers urination to erase its message and leave their own in its place domestic cats claim ownership of their human guardians by rubbing scent glands in their necks against the owners legs people imagine that this is a sign of affection but its actually their way of branding you as their property for organisms that have the ability to interpret it light plays a very important role as a carrier of information about the object off which it last bounced which enables them to see where they are and what is around them the visual field is very complex and the processing of its information occupies a significant proportion of the human brain one of our most familiar forms of information media is the newspaper its stories inform or misinform us about what is happening in the world newspapers are made of paper which provides a convenient monochrome background field on which information can be represented in the form of differentlycoloured ink placed on the paper in such a way as to create distinctive shapes pictures of symbols such as letters and numbers if a picture is worth a thousand words then a thousand words can give you the picture and words can be written as sequences of symbols and symbols can be represented by little pictures it sounds circular but its not what makes symbols informational is their distinctiveness from each other the property of distinctiveness is the key thing that separates information from noise if someone tells you something you already know they are not being very informative if the sky is full of clouds another one just like the others doesnt mean much but if the sky is full of fluffy white clouds and an unusual black one appears on the horizon it gets your attention because its information its information because its distinctive ancient egyptians mesapotamians and greeks staring up at the heavens on a clear night studied the twinkling lights that pepper the darkness of space they noticed that the lights were not randomly scattered but retained their relative positions within a great wheel that seemed to slowly revolve around the earth with the exception of wanderers the greeks called planets and a particularly big one that the mesapotamians called sin the one we call the moon because of their distinctiveness against the dark background the ancient peoples of earth could discern the planets and stars individually and track their progress across the sky and so the planets the stars and their constellations became heavenly symbols and they soon acquired anthropocentric earthly meanings in the imaginations of astrologers computation symbol processing symbols are signals that designate information values what computers do compute is process symbols in the th century a computer was a person who with pencil and paper worked out the arithmetic calculations needed to keep track of the financial position of a business the title was later conferred on people who worked out other numerical calculations such as the values to put in mathematical tables that listed the values of various functions including the sight reduction tables that were used by navigators for calculating their geographical position based on their visual observation of the height of a known star and the date and time of the sighting the original meaning of the word computer fell into disuse once the job ceased to exist when electronic machines were invented that could do numerical calculations quicker cheaper and more reliably which was very important to the military being able to reliably calculate where artillery shells would land weik made the machines of war more effective although reliable numbercrunching was the design purpose of the early inventors of mechanical and electronic computers we have since found that their machines can represent transduce and process other forms of information too all kinds words pictures sounds music videos speech and more electronic digital dataprocessing computers use just two symbols digits the english word digit comes from the latin word digitus meaning thing to point out with from the latin verb dicere meaning to say to point out from which the english word diction is also derived fingers are handy for pointing so digitus became the roman word for finger too and to this day people often wag a finger when making a forceful statement and as fingers are also handy for counting the english word digit later became synonymous with the word numeral which is a symbol designating a number roman numerals were based on a mixture of multiples of and we have fingers on one hand our modern decimal notation based on a single base of came to europe from persia somewhere around the th century in this notation numbers are written as denoting the sum of multiples of successive powers of reading from right to left but we dont need a base of and different symbols in order to be able to write a string of numerals to denote a number we could and digital computers do use a base of and just symbols instead a binary digit or bit for short represents one of values and so for example the value represented in decimal notation as the string of symbols is represented in binary notation as which denotes x x x x x when we write a decimal numeral on a piece of paper we dont write the symbol itself but a picture of it for example the third decimal digit is commonly drawn as two curves one on top of the other digital computers draw their own pictures of our symbols as different sequences of bits using an encoding convention called unicode the nd unicode character is which denotes the third decimal numeral with bits unicode can encode over a hundred thousand different pictures more than enough to distinguish all the symbols of all the alphabets of every human language the only meaning a symbol has by itself is its uniqueness which is informationally equivalent to its position in the alphabet a position distinct from all the other symbols and yet with only this humble property of distinctiveness and just the simplest form of structure the onedimensional sequence symbols can represent all the wealth of meaning contained in a poem or a description of the laws of physics living computers have their own physical symbol alphabet one as old as life itself about billion years old it is the alphabet of chemical signals by which biological cells manage their internal processes and communicate with each other life computation artificial electronic computers are made of processors hardware and processes software the software tells the hardware how to remember and process its data but in a natural living computer there is no separation of hardware and software nor is there a simple distinction between process and memory all living computers from the smallest bacterium to the largest blue whale are made of cells each experience causes the cell to modify itself in some way according to its recipe of life inherited from its ancestors and encoded in the form of dna contained within each and every cell the inputs to a cell are chemical signals sent to it by other cells or in the case of sensor cells the environment and substances it eats by endocytosis its computational processes are its metabolic pathways and its outputs are its movements and the products it exports by exocytosis cellprocesssignals food products movements atp metabolic pathways are characterised as anabolic building up which synthesise large molecules peptides proteins polysaccharides lipids and nucleic acids from small ones such as amino acids consuming energy in the process and catabolic breaking down which decompose large molecules into small ones transferring the energy of their chemical bonds to the universal energycarrier of life adenosine triphosphate atp which anabolic pathways use in their reactions power stations convert the energy in coal to electricity which drives the computations of electronic computers living cells have their own builtin power stations to provide energy for their computations cell respiration is a cascade of metabolic reactions glycolosis the krebs cycle and the electron transport chain that transfer the energy of the intricately bound bonds of glucose into the more immediately utilisable ones of atp cell respiration when a cell needs energy it breaks the bond between the second and third phosphate groups of atp to release its energy forming adenosine diphosphate adp and a free phosphate molecule when a cell has excess energy it stores it by forming atp from adp and free phosphate in this way atp is a kind of portable battery able to transfer energy between spatiallyseparate metabolic reactions for this reason it is often called lifes energy currency originally the energy comes from the sun plants capture it during photosynthesis and with phosphorous absorbed from the soil convert it to chemical energy in the form of atp using this energy plants produce carbohydrates fats and proteins which are eaten by animals which digest the plants fabric and use its constituent compounds to make their own atp when the animal dies its phosphorus eventually goes back into the soil and the cycle of life continues entropy is a measure of the disorder unpredictability of a system a jumble of bricks has more entropy than those same bricks organised into a physical structure like a house and a random collection of bits has more entropy than one organised into a computer program entropy increases says the second law of thermodynamics pour cold milk into hot coffee in a warm room and the heat energy of the coffee will flow into the milk until it has all more or less reached the same temperature the thermal information of the different temperatures of the milk and coffee has evaporated the entropy of the system inside the cup has increased but if you drink it something remarkable happens its entropy decreases schrdinger its atoms stop bouncing around in a brownian motion way and become more organised until you die that is as they enter your digestive system the atoms of milky coffee become data to the information processors of the stomach intestine bloodstream and from there to all cells of your body and mind where they become building blocks for metabolic processes that create cell structures movements and chemical signals for example the atoms that made up the cholesterol in milk can wind up becoming part of a steroid hormone manufactured by your adrenal gland far from having a brownian motion in a cupsized sea the steroid flows purposefully through the bloodstream looking for cells to talk to through their andrenoreceptors this is as it should be you were designed by nature to process and repackage the goodness in milk even if it was thinking of your mothers milk rather than daisy the cows which has about half as much cholesterol as human milk however you arent programmed to process the data of caffeine which sneaks across your bloodbrain barrier and tricks the adenosine receptors of your neurons into thinking they have received a calm down signal because they cant tell the difference between adenosine and caffeine and this confuses the neurons completely because caffeine doesnt affect the adenosine receptor in quite the expected way and ends up antagonising blocking its normal function which is to tell its neuron to slow down so the neuron doesnt slow down with this happening all over the place the overall effect is that your neurons and you and become more active than usual even though this may make your behaviour more chaotic than usual the entropy of the caffeine molecules themselves has decreased because they have become part of your organised system the processes of life reduce the entropy of the atoms of their raw materials by organising them into cells and systems of cells each cell is like a little factory taking in raw materials and putting out manufactured products but its not a factory made of inert materials rooted to the spot on an industrial estate it can move plants may not have wings or legs and are rooted in the ground but they are anything but stationary their roots are constantly on the move seeking out sources of water their stems climb upwards seeking the light their branches spread their leaves in the sun breathing in carbon dioxide and breathing out oxygen fish dont have wings or legs but they can swim circles around a hawk or cheatah simply by flexing their muscles muscle cells expand and contract but they are not the only kind of cells that move all cells even bone cells and teeth cells pulse with the vibrancy of life inside every cell are microtubules miniature monorails along which motorised transporter proteins called kinesins truck cargoes of macromolecules manufactured within the cell by its ribosomes kinesins have two heads connected via a short flexible neck to a long tail its cargo binds to its tail while its twin heads alternately bind to the molecules along the microtubule in a kind of stepping motion power for the kinesins work is provided by the ubiquitous energycarrying molecule of life atp common sense the earth garden of plenty is full of odours to delight or appall our senses smell is one of our most elemental and immediate senses capable of provoking the most intense feeling of intimacy contentment and pleasure or the strongest reaction of disgust and abhorrence the processes that determine our reactions to different smells are the result of complex computations performed by the cells of the brain and body odorant molecules are the symbols of the alphabet of smells the olfactory epithelium has millions of tiny hairlike receptor cells packed into an area about the size of a postage stamp the membrane of the tip of a receptor cell is studded with several different molecular receptor molecules each receptor molecule has a particular physical and chemical structure that enables it to bind with recognise only one kind of odorant molecule peterlin et al a binding event causes the receptor molecule to change its shape inside the receptor cell which initiates a series of chemical changes called a signalling pathway inside the cell giving rise to an electrical signal that is sent to the olfactory bulb which integrates signals from many receptors and passes on the information it has computed to the brain axel and buck found that mice have about different types of olfactory receptor cell humans have only about but we can differentiate about odorant combinations that we recognise as distinct smells such as the aroma of coffee which is a combination of about of its different aromatic compounds ref but there is more to smell than meets the nose information in the form of chemical signals is the fundamental mechanism by which all cells including neurons communicate with each other every cell in every body from the smallest bacterium to the largest blue whale is an autonomous agent that reads and processes chemical messages passed to it the human body is made of trillion cells of different types but all of them skin bone muscle heart stomach kidneys intestines and all the rest including the neurons of the brain and nervous system communicate with each other by the same basic mechanism of sending and receiving chemical signals the origin of life and its early evolution is still uncertain but all known lifeforms are made of cells constructed of the same basic structural and functional chemical building blocks carbohydrates such as glucose lipids such as cholesterol proteins and nucleic acids there are two main types of cell prokaryotes archaea and bacteria and eukaryotes plants and animals prokaryote cells are much smaller and much less complicated than eukayote ones prokaryotes are ancient species some of which called extremophiles can still be found living in places like the hot springs of yellowstone park and inside thermal vents miles under the sea as well as many others living in less harsh environments lifeform sizes the pace of progress in computer hardware miniaturisation is truly remarkable what just a few decades ago would have required an entire room full of electronics can now be packed into a tiny chip smaller than the nail on your little finger the feature size the width of an electrically conducting or insulating path of the latest microprocessor is about m several hundred transistors made from this technology could fit on a human red blood cell about m in diameter intel the microelectronics industry is undoubtedly a modern achilles flying across the sea of progress on the winged heels of technology whereas nature is only the lumbering tortoise of evolution but she did have a billion year head start on us the nucleoid of a bacterial cell contains its genome a multiplycoiled string of nearly million nucleotides of which there are just kinds adenine cytosine thymine and guanine thus the genome is like a book written in a language having just symbols actg because there are symbols each symbol carries two bits of information because there are four combinations of two bits the latest technology electronic flash memory is capable of storing bits per floating gate transistor so it would require such transistors to store million bits which would require a space the size of red blood cells assuming we could fit transistors on one of them but nature fits that same information into a bacterium which is the size of a red blood cell so her miniaturisation of information storage components is times more precisely engineered than mans animal cells employ a host of chemical signals each having its own special meaning in terms of the effect it has the terminology of chemical signals is rather inconsistent being derived sometimes from their functional roles and sometimes from their chemical structures those of neuron synapses are called neurotransmitters those of the endocrine system are called peptide hormones and steroids paracrine signals are called growth factors and clotting factors and those of the immune system are called eicosanoids prostaglandins and leukotrienes and cytokines interleukins interferons and growth factors major endocrine glands pineal gland pituitary gland thyroid gland thymus adrenal gland pancreas ovary testes endocrine hormones are broadcast throughout an animal via the highway of the body the bloodstream which functions as a medium for the transportation and distribution of chemical signals as well as the raw materials such as oxygen and nutrients and outputs manufactured products and waste products of cell processes there are many different hormones but each one targets only cells that can read its message peptide hormone messages are read by receptors embedded in the cell membrane the smaller steroids pass through the cell wall how and are read by receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus membrane the heart lungs kidneys liver thymus skin placenta and gonads release hormones as do several glands specialised to hormone production the pineal gland located in the middle of the brain secretes melatonin a hormone that regulates the wakesleep cycle the hypothalamus located in the lower central part of the brain is the primary link between the endocrine and nervous systems factors such as emotions and environmental conditions such as temperature and light influence the hypothalmus to produce chemical messages that regulate the activity of the pituitary gland about the size of a pea the pituitary gland is often called the master gland because it makes hormones that control other glands growth hormone stimulates the growth of bone and other body tissues and plays a role in the bodys handling of nutrients and minerals vasopressin also called antidiuretic hormone regulates body water balance through its effect on the kidneys and urine output thyrotropin or thyroid stimulating hormone tsh stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones adrenocorticotropin hormone acth stimulates the adrenal gland endorphins which act on the nervous system to reduce sensitivity to pain prolactin activates milk production in women who are breastfeeding and many other functions related to reproduction bancroft oxytocin has many effects associated with mating childbirth it triggers the contractions of the uterus that occur during labor childrearing and pairbonding follicles in the thyroid produce thyroglobulin a storage form of thyroid hormone tsh signals from the pituitary gland cause conversion of thyroglobulin into thyroxine and triiodothyronine which control the rate at which cells burn fuels from food to produce energy calcitonin is also secreted by large cells in the thyroid it plays a role in regulation of calcium which is used in bone and teeth formation nerve functioning muscle contraction and blood clotting attached to the thyroid are the parathyroids four tiny glands that function together and release parathyroid hormone which together with calcitonin regulates the level of calcium in the blood the adrenal glands one on top of each kidney have two parts the outer part called the adrenal cortex takes its instructions from the pituitary hormone acth and produces three kinds of corticosteroid mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids and androgens the mineralocorticoid aldosterone regulates electrolyte balance of sodium and potassium ions in the body it does this by influencing the kidney when aldosterone is at a high concentration in the blood the kidney retains more sodium and loses more potassium than normal glucocorticoids such as cortisol produce a longterm slow response to stress by raising blood glucose levels through the breakdown of fats and proteins they also suppress the immune response and inhibit the inflammatory response the androgens dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione are converted to testosterone by hair follicles the sebaceous glands the prostate and the external genitalia and are involved in estrogen synthesis in adipose tissue the inner adrenal gland the adrenal medulla produces catecholamines such as adrenaline called epinephrine in usa and noradrenaline which underlie the fightorflight response directly increasing heart rate triggering the release of glucose from energy stores and increasing blood flow to skeletal muscle dilation of pupils dilation of air passages in the lungs and narrowing of blood vessels in nonessential organs glucose which provides the energy needed for cell metabolism is manufactured by the liver when so commanded by an adrenaline signal adrenoceptors are present in the muscle within the walls of blood vessels of the extremities noradrenaline causes the muscle to contract resulting in a narrowing of the blood vessels in the extremities which redirects blood to essential organs such as the heart and brain it also produces greater resistance for the heart to beat against which increases blood pressure with dilated blood vessels and air passages the body is able to pass more blood to the muscles and get more oxygen into the lungs increasing physical performance for short bursts of time to cope with dangerous and unexpected situations after a meal blood glucose levels rise prompting the pancreas to release insulin which causes cells to take up glucose and liver and skeletal muscle cells to form the carbohydrate glycogen as glucose levels in the blood fall insulin production is inhibited and glucagon is released which causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose which in turn is released into the blood to maintain glucose levels within a homeostatic range male gonads the testes secrete androgens including testosterone which regulates the production of sperm and has various side effects such as deepening of the voice growth of facial and pubic hair and muscle growth female gonads the ovaries secrete estrogen and progesterone which are involved in pregnancy and the regulation of the menstrual cycle and have various side effects such as breast growth the accumulation of body fat around the hips and thighs and the growth spurt that occurs during puberty hormone levels are managed by negative feedback systems for example the pituitary gland senses the level of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream and adjusts its release of thyrotropin the pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones when the blood calcium level rises the parathyroid glands sense the change and decrease their secretion of parathyroid hormone the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis hpa has a wellcharacterized circadian pattern that is under the control of the suprachiasmatic nuclei scn of the hypothalamus whose activation in turn is regulated by light the periventricular hypothalamic network plays a role on coordinating neuroendocrine autonomic and behavioural outflows to circadian immune and psychogenic stimuli hpa feedback loops occur at different time domains referred as slow in response to chronic exposure to glucocorticoids intermediate and fast feedback both in response to stress and to circadian events the control of hpa circadian rhythmicity depends on hypothalamicpituitary activity driven by corticotropinreleasing hormone crh and arginine vasopressin acth and adrenal responsiveness to acth this activity is ultimately driven by light at the scn and by food at the ventromedial hypothalamus which regulates the expression of the crh gene stressful stimuli either physical or psychological can disrupt the hpa axis homeostasis those stimuli can originate from extrahypothalamic sites such as the cathecolaminergic cell groups throughout brainstem the spinohypothalamicspinothalamicspinoreticulothalamic pain pathways proinflammatory cytokines originated from the immune system and psychogenic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex and from the hippocampus pazfilho et al gonadotropinreleasing hormone gnrh triggers a cascade of hormones that prime the body for sex and procreation humans as well as birds mice and sheep release gonadotropininhibitory hormone gnih which puts a brake on the cascade gnih receptors are found on gnrh neurons in the hypothalamus and in the pituitary gland and in the gonads its overall effect is to inhibit reproduction but at different levels of the reproductive axis stress affects levels of gnih explaining the drop in fertility attributable to stress because reproductive hormones often promote the growth of cancer cells gnih might have theraputic value as an anticancer agent treatment of hormoneresponsive cancers involves gnrh antagonists or very high doses of gnrh which cause side effects gnih therapy may be more effective the human gnih gene produces a precursor protein comprising and amino acid mature peptides one of the peptides in sheep has the same amino acid sequence as the human peptide the human hormone has been shown to inhibit the release of gonadotropin in sheep ubuka et al reading the message signal transduction when a messenger molecule arrives at a cell it triggers a cascade of biocomputations inside the cell the cytoplasm of a cell is enclosed within a a kind of liquid crystal waterproof plastic a phospholipid which contains and protects the life machinery of the cell the membrane is impermeable to water but is studded with receptor proteins that can bind to particular messenger molecules we can think of a messenger molecule as a key and the receptor as a lock if the key fits the lock the message is received this is called a binding event because the molecules concerned temporarily bind together for this reason messenger molecules are called ligands later on a feedback system within the cell undoes the binding and deactivates the messenger freeing up the receptor to receive new messages in the future the deactivated messenger is recycled by other processes a binding event between a messenger molecule and a receptor protein causes a conformational change in the receptor which ripples through to the part of it exposed inside the cell the process is called signal transduction because the information represented by the messenger on the outside is transduced into information represented by the different shape of the transducer inside the cell its new shape allows it to bind with another protein called a transducer inside the cell cytoplasm for example adrenaline is a hormone secreted into the bloodstream by the adrenal gland when the brain decides urgent action is required when it arrives at a cell capable of reading its message the following signal transduction takes place nobelorg the message a molecule of adrenaline binds to its specific receptor thereby the transducer a g protein is activated this in turn stimulates the amplifier adenylate cyclase to produce a second messenger cyclic amp with the help of atp this provokes a cascade of enzymatic reactions which include the phosphorylation of glycogen which is transformed to glucose which the cell uses to generate atp glycogen phosphorylation can also alter the proteins of gated ion channels intracell ion concentrations mostly potasium and calcium ions affect what cells do muscle cells for example require a certain concentration of calcium ions in the cells cytoplasm before contracting ion concentration also regulates exocytosis the export of material out of a cell of waste products and signalling molecules each ion channel conducts a specific species of ion such as sodium or potassium in free space electrical forces drive charges from high energy pockets to low ones just as variations in atmospheric pressure create winds of air flowing from high to low pressure areas the cell membrane and the gating of ion channels manage this natural tendency like the steel jacket and governer of a steam engine control the pressure inside its boiler large molecule messengers such as adrenaline bind to receptors in the cell membrane but small ones such as steroid hormones slip through the cell wall and bind to receptors within the cell cytoplasm or embedded in the membrane of its nucleus there are five kinds of human steroid progesterone regulates events during pregnancy corticoids suppress inflammation reactions and regulate mineral and sugar metabolism androgens promote male sex development and maintain male sex characteristics estrogens promote female sex development in plants auxin is an example of a steroid hormone that regulates longitudinal cell structure so as to allow bending of the stalk or stem in phototrophic response most steroid hormones are neither basic nor acidic with the exception of estradole which is slightly acidic due to a phenol component all cellular functions involve directly or indirectly the genetic information contained in the nucleotides made of nucleic acids of a cells genome contained inside its nucleus when messenger molecules bind with receptors in the cell or its membrane they cause cascades of anabolic and catabolic biocomputations which perform cell functions such as the manufacture of protein products from the raw materials of amino acids according to the recipe of the cells dna plant cells have strong walls but they are not shut off from the rest of the world the wall is composed of layers of cellulose microfibres embedded in a matrix of pectin and hemicellulose the matrix is porous which allows nutrients and chemical signals made of small molecules to seep through the growing tip of a plant has light sensitive receptors which when activated induce yamamura and hasegawa the release of substances in the side of the plant towards the light that antagonize inhibit the action of auxin a plant hormone its normal function provokes a proton pump within a cell that expells h ions in its wall which in turn activates enzymes called expansins that break bonds in the cell wall structure making the cell walls less rigid which in turn causes the cell to swell from its internal turgor pressure inhibiting auxin function in the cells of the plant stem on the lit side of the plant means they do not swell whereupon the different amounts of swelling on each side of the stem cause it to curve towards the light some leaves have a specialized organ called a pulvinus at their base made of thickwalled waterconducting vascular tissue surrounded by thinwalled motor cells which can undergo visible swelling and shrinking in an analogy with the muscles that move animal joints the motor cells on the lower site of the pulvinus are called flexor cells and on the upper site extensor cells upon receipt of a chemical signal called a phytochrome tranmsitted from a light sensor in response to its stimulus extensor cells open potassium ion channels which increases the cells tugor pressure causing it to expand upon darkness k channels in the extensor cells close but open in the flexor cells which lose turgor pressure and shrink the pulvinus joint looses its rigidity and lets the leaf droop stomatal pores in the epidermis of aerial parts of plants facilitate gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere stomatal pores are surrounded by pairs of guard cells that mediate stomatal pore opening and closing guard cells respond to diverse stimuli including blue light co concentrations drought pathogen attack and plant hormones including abscisic acid aba mediated by ion transport across the plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane of guard cells and by organic solute content changes mori et al now where did all this marvellous computational machinery come from the term used to describe the sensible behaviour of motile bacteria navigating in a field of molecules is chemotaxis it expresses the observation that bacteria move toward concentrations of molecules they can use and away from those that are toxic to them bacteria move by means of flagella which whip around in circles by means of the motor apparatus shown here which is one of very few biological examples of a wheel motor the multiple flagella of ecoli are coiled together clockwisely when they all rotate anticlockwisely they have the effect of little turning screws that move the fluid they live in in just the way that archimedes rediscovered billion years later when looking for a way to lift water from a well as the fluid moves across its body so the bacterium moves forwards like a helicopter or propellor just as leonardo realised two thousand years after archimedes and john ericsson who patented the ship propellor three hundred years after him who says bacteria arent intelligent whereas anticlockwise rotation of its flagella drive the bacterium forwards their clockwise rotation creates a turbulence that causes the bacterium to tumble over and point in a new direction with just these two kinds of motion propelling itself straight ahead or tumbling over flagellate bacteria navigate their way in the world we can think of ecoli as a tiny robot programmed by instructions in the form of the functional properties of its inner assemblies and the proteins inside it as shown in the flow diagram of its processes which shows four different transmembrane receptors working together each receptor can respond to a molecule of a particular range of chemicals from its environment by becoming bound to it when it does so the receptor protein changes in such a way that the part of it on the inside of the bacterium can bind to cheb proteins that are hanging around waiting for their chance to do something the signal transduction chain results in two end products a signal in the form of a phosphorylated chey protein is sent to the flagellum motor complex where it can bind to a protein called flim which affects the rotation of a flagellum and a feedback signal protein cher is created which antagonises any binding of the transmembrane receptors to other ligands the feedback only lasts a few seconds in the long run this combines with the two possible modes of flagellar rotation to have the overall effect of causing the bacterium to climb concentration gradients of things it likes and drift away from those it doesnt bacteria often live in colonies and communicate with each other by sending and sensing small signalling molecules called autoinducers which identify them to their neighbours each species has its own signature in addition there is one special autoinducer that all bacteria can produce and sense in a process called quorum sensing waters and bassler bacteria adapt their behaviour according to the numbers they sense of their own and other species in their neighbourhood as each individual in a species group has the same decisionmaking machinery the entire group tends to behave in the same way this gives them the survival advantage of strength in numbers in competitive situations such as when they are under attack from an animals immune system although bacterial signal transduction is a different set of reactions from those of eukaryotic cells there is evidence marlovitz et al that a bacterial protein called feob may be a primordial archetype of the g proteins it took a long time over billion years for evolution to get from stromatolites to lucy the earliest known hominid johansen edy and just another thousandth of that time to get from her to us but it would seem that the bacteria and we can thank our common ancestor for giving our cells their sense of smell so they can work together so we can exist seeing is believing many living things engage in commensal relationships in which each party benefits in some way from the interaction commensal relationships involve communication so that each side knows who and where the other one is for example flowers look pretty to us but that is not their purpose in life they are there to attract insects like bees plants are mostly made of stems and leaves stems are usually dullcoloured and leaves are usually green but flowers are strikingly painted in all the bright colours of the rainbow among marine life bright colours usually signal toxicity this deters predators an aversion to eating brightlycoloured things seems to have carried across from the marine world where life probably began into the world of land animals there are very few herbivores that eat brightlycoloured flowers just as well for if herbivores saw flowers as food plant reproduction would be devastated and the entire food web of the ecosystem would fall apart flowers advertise themselves using special ultraviolet colours that bees can clearly differentiate from the surrounding vegetation as we are not bees we dont know exactly what a flower looks like to a bee but we can imagine what it might look like by frequency shifting the image that is reflected by a flower when it is bathed only in ultraviolet light bees are programmed by their instincts to associate glowing ultraviolet colours with the presence of nectar the colours advertise the promise of nectar that bees need for their energetic lives plant nectar is usually at the bottom of a deep well to get to it the bee has to crawl past the flowers stigma the entrance to its ovaries and anther the bee doesnt manage to get away until its hairy body has brushed against the flowers anthers so that its sticky sacks of pollen get stuck to it ready for transport to another flower later on when the bee feels hungry again once the anthers have been emptied the stigma opens so that any visitors carrying pollen from another flower will have it scraped off into the stigma down the style and into the ovaries by keeping the stigma closed until the anthers have been emptied the flower avoids selfpollination whence its children will reap the evolutionary benefits of a mixed marriage over many generations inbreeds tend to develop disadvantageous characteristics flowers are computers the process by which a flower recognises that its anthers have been emptied and decides only then to open its stigma is a computation and so are bees a bee has to process the information advertised by the plant to know where to go for that lovely nectar pooh bear finds the honey produced by bees from nectar by its smell as bees have olfactory receptors on their antennae it is very likely that they can recognise the heady perfumes of flowers as well as identify their ultraviolet displays some flowers have a more seductive and deceitful method of advertising themselves to insects the hammerhead orchid of australia tricks male thynnid wasps into visiting it by mimicking the shape and smell of a female wasp as a male wasp attempts to mate with what it thinks is a female a plastic hinge on the orchid causes the wasp to sway back and forth brushing against the orchids sticky pollen sacks which stick to its back when it later performs the same act with another hammerhead orchid the sacks will be detached and the flower fertilised trickery for the purpose of exploitation is common within the kingdoms of biota and often the false enticement is sexual allure there is more to light than meets the gleam in the eye but you dont need an eye like ours in order to see what is going on the brittlestar ophiocoma wendtii is covered with hundreds of hemispherical calcite bumps on its upper body each bump acts as a lens focussing light on a bundle of nerve fibres underneath beside each lens are dark pigmented cells chromatophores which migrate to the surface of the lens when the light is bright the brittlestar puts on its sunglasses the animal responds to sudden changes of light intensity by running away even if it doesnt have what we would recognise as a brain it certainly has a neural network capable of processing light information making decisions directing its muscles to move its arms rhythmically so it can scuttle away and navigating itself to a place of safety a change of light intensity whether across time or across space conveys information we dont yet know whether o wendtiis miniature eyes create an image in its minds eye but experiments by strange and howard showed that the compound eyes of a dragonfly provide enough resolution for it to be able to perceive the position and orientation of its environment and when performing rapid turns monitor its position so as to be able to adjust its flight attitude which is vital for stability we may not be as smart as dragonflies we havent figured out how to fly like them yet but we can read a newspaper when we read the patterns of light and dark reflected from the shapes of the pictures of symbols on the paper fall upon a light sensitive molecules such as rhodopsin in the membranes of photoreceptor neurons at the back of our eyes ordinarily a receptor neuron constantly emits signalling proteins neurotransmitters into its terminal synapses but when light falls upon its rhodopsin a chain of chemical events takes place that results in the photoreceptor membrane becoming hyperpolarised which causes the neuron to stop releasing neurotransmitters the behaviour of a photoreceptor neuron is rather like that of an electronic transistor circuit called an inverter or not gate where a potential on the input a switches off the normal flow of the vddvss current so that the output of the circuit q is the opposite of its input several transistors can be wired up in a circuit to compute a logical function of two singlebit signals one logical function that is very useful for building electronic processors is nand the opposite of and because each and every logical function of two bits such as the calculation of the sum or carry bit of binary addition can be computed by a composition of not and nand functions inverters and nand gates are the standard building blocks of the integrated circuits of digital computer processors with just these basic building blocks processors can be built that are capable of being programmed to perform highly complex computations such as predicting the weather or figuring out how to beat a world chess champion the principle of performing complex computations by the composition of simple ones is realised in living computers by networks of neuron cells connected by synapses these are the computational building blocks of brains a synapse is a junction between an axon terminal of a transmitter presynaptic neuron and a dendrite of a receiver postsynaptic neuron the transmission of information across a synapse operates by the mechanism of chemical signal transduction a nerve impulse action potential in the axon of the transmitter neuron causes signalling molecules neurotransmitters to be released from its terminals into the synaptic gap the neurotransmitters bind to receptors in the receiving neuron prompting a signal transduction sequence which results in the opening of ion channels in the receiver dendrite causing electrical charges to flow into it excitatory or out from it inhibitory if at any time the result of all the synapses engaged in by receiver dendrites is that the axon hillock of the receiver neuron becomes sufficiently energised a pulse of action potential is propagated along its axon the combined effect of as many as synapses determines whether the electrical potential induced in the receiver neurons axon hillock is sufficient to reach the threshold required to trigger a nerve impulse action potential along its axon for passing on to other neurons or effector cells often a single input a is not sufficient and several inputs have to cooccur b or overlap in time c the only kind of signal that can be propagated along the axis of a neuron is a pulse of action potential axons carry binary signals the signal induced in a receiver axon is either a pulse or no pulse whether a receiver pulses or not is dependent of the strengths and frequencies of presynaptic pulses to the extent that their combined effect determines whether the receivers threshold potentiation is reached the amplitude of the pulse induced in the receiver once its potentiation threshold has been reached is purely a function of the receiver neurons particular chemistry hence we can think of it as a binary logical signal or maybe a vibration higher frequencies are stronger signals more likely to induce action potentials in neurons with which they have synapses either way a synapse performs a computation that lies at the heart of any logical reasoning system an inference a synapse expresses an inference rule if this then that it will infer that that is true if it thinks that this is true an inference rule is an association a belief that its output can be inferred from its inputs an autonomic reflex is made by a synapse at the spinal cord between an sensory neuron carrying a message from a sensor and a motor neuron carrying a message to a muscle if toohot then withdraw if kneetap then kneejerk but even in the case of an autonomic reflex a single synapse is not the whole story the effector neuron also receives messages from the brain and the reflex doesnt always happen kennard a more complex emotional response thoughtful assessment or perceptual impression is made in the brain as a result of thousands maybe millions of synapses making inferences we are born with many synapses already in place put there by the creative miracle of gestation which also created our biological machinery for making new synapses for learning through feedback there are lots of things to learn a baby will put anything within reach into its mouth but very soon thanks to feedback from experience the developing child starts to acquire a sense of discrimination that some things are yukky and others are tasty it forms beliefs our beliefs are inferences and inference rules they express our understanding of the relationships between things for example that things that look or smell a particular way can be inferred to possess certain properties such as being nice or nasty once formed beliefs become powerful filters of new information so much so that much available information can be ignored or misinterpreted only a part of what is perceived comes through the senses from the object the remainder always comes from within luckiesh we dont see what is in front of our eyes we see what we think is there we see what we can believe the intuitive semantics of inference rules that neatly capture the concept of a heuristic a rule of thumb that works most of the time led newell and simon to use them as the basis of their theory of the computational basis of human problem solving their work was very influential in efforts to produce computer programs capable of demonstrating artificial intelligence particularly those that later came to be labelled expert systems mccorduck although such programs could demonstrate some impressive abilities they also suffered from a kind of myopia they could only reason within a limited sphere and lacked the ability to handle situations beyond this limit minsky observes that human reasoning doesnt suffer this same brittleness and seems to involve more use of analogy than deduction however even though humans have very wideranging powers of commonsense they too are capable of abject myopia turning a blind eye to things that dont fit in with their existing beliefs and maintaining beliefs that are mutually inconsistent part of the reason for this phenomenon may be the physical localisation of brain function for example the fusiform gyrus located just inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes is where face recognition is performed damage to this area causes capgras syndrome in which a person can no longer recognize peoples faces even though she can still recognize their voices she cant even recognize herself in the mirror a rarer syndrome called the capgras delusion is when a patient believes a loved one has been replaced by an imposter ramachandran and blakeslee deduce that his curious disorder could be due to localised damage to the link between the fusiform gyrus and the amygdala so the patient does not experience their normal emotional response to seeing a loved one lacking this normal feedback the cortex rationalises that the person they are seeing is not the one they love the cortex also has trouble reorganising its circuits that interpret data from the peripheral nervous system when that data ceases to arrive after a damaged limb has been amputated the patient can continue to vividly sense its imaginary presence called a phantom limb she knows that the limb is not there but nevertheless receives compelling sensory experiences of its imaginary existence because although the limb no longer exists the nerve fibres it was once connected to are still intact and being stimulated by other connections anyone who once had a paralysed but painful limb amputated can subsequently experience having a paralysed phantom arm with the same pain because the brain has learned the sensation of having a painfully paralysed arm and this learned belief remains even after the arm itself has ceased to exist to help a patient with this condition unlearn his false belief ramachandran came up with the idea of giving him a virtual arm through the technically simple device of a box with a mirror in it the patient puts his normal hand beside the mirror so that when he looks in the box it looks to him like he has two hands when asked to move his normal hand he receives the illusion of an imaginary other hand also moving he knows its not real he knows its just a mirror reflection but its a vivid sensory experience after some weeks of repeated practice this visual feedback creates new connections in his brain which circumvent the old circuits that had produced the feelings of pain seeing then is a matter of fitting perceived images to existing belief structures but you dont need eyes to see when a sound signal is sent into a medium such as air or water part of it will be reflected back if it strikes an object the distance to the object can be calculated by measuring the time between when the signal is sent out and when the reflected sound or echo is received the size of the reflecting object is visible by the spread of the echo anyone experienced in using an inexpensive fishfinder can tell the difference between echoes produced by the seabed and those of a school of fish on a sonar image visual display screen whales and dolphins use active sonar to identify underwater objects and to help find food these marine mammals produce very sophisticated sounds such as frequency sweeps and chains of clicks that tell them much about the target when they are reflected back bats emit constant frequency strobed pulses of sound waves some emit sounds from their mouth which they hold open as they fly others emit sound through their nose these sounds are reflected by objects in the environment giving rise to a unique auditory power spectrum signature for each type of object by recognising the special echo signatures of particular prey species the bat can distinguish them from the background auditory profile including such things as reflections from stationary objects such as trees a bats prey are small quickmoving insects a bat listens carefully to the echoes that return to it the bats brain determines how long it takes a noise to return and figures out how far away an object is the bat can also determine where the object is how big it is and in what direction it is moving the bat can tell if an insect is to the right or left by comparing when the sound reaches its right ear to when the sound reaches its left ear if the sound of the echo reaches the right ear before it reaches the left ear the insect is obviously to the right the bats ears have a complex collection of folds that help it determine an insects vertical position echoes coming from below will hit the folds of the outer ear at a different point than sounds coming from above and so will sound different when they reach the bats inner ear a bat can tell how big an insect is based on the intensity of the echo a smaller object will reflect less of the sound wave and so will produce a less intense echo the bat can sense in which direction the insect moving is based on the pitch of the echo if the insect is moving away from the bat the returning echo will have a lower pitch than the original sound while the echo from an insect moving toward the bat will have a higher pitch this difference is due to the doppler effect doppler shift occurs when sound is generated by or reflected off by a moving object one species of bat uses frequency modulated echolocation fm and another uses constant frequency echolocation cf in both cases the bat emits pulses of sound and listens for echoes of insects or suitable preys in between the intervals after detection of a target the pulse rate increases this increases the rate of information update when the bat is getting nearer to its prey part of the signature recognition processing performed by bats requires taking into account the effect of movement as the bat moves towards an object reflected waves are dopplershifted if the object contains moving parts such as the flapping wings of a moth these too will affect the dopplershifted echo signal as the bat approaches a moth it increases the frequency of its pulses to obtain a higher resloution auditory image and avoid interference between transmitted and reflected signals precisely what neural processes occur in the bat to perform the very complex computations involved is still unknown but it has been shown that different areas of the bats brain are active at different phases of the approach capture depart sequence of mice and microbes one problem that has interested mathematicians is to figure out whether a mathematical formalism could pose and answer any question the entscheidungsproblem perhaps the most famous contribution to this question of all questions is the mathematical proof of kurt godel which basically concludes that the problem is inherently unsolvable his formalism led to a version of the selfcontradiction paradox which goes something like this if a man says i am telling you a lie then if his statement is true it must be a lie and viceversa alan turing realised there was a parallel between what could be defined by a mathematical formalism and what could be computed by a machine to do this he reduced the concept of computation to its simplest elements input process output he conceived an abstract model of computation now called a turing machine tm composed of two basic elements a long strip of paper on which the machine could read or write one symbol at a time and a registry of numbered states of mind that processed the symbols on the tape each state contained a single transformation rule that read the symbol on the tape erased it or wrote a symbol in its place which could be the same one moved the tape one place left or right or left it where it was and specified the next state to be entered since each state in the registry is uniquely identified by its state number we can imagine stringing them together in a tape of their own so a tm is a string of symbols that operates upon another string of symbols turing was able to show that with just this simple apparatus his imaginary automaton was theoretically complete in the the sense that for every mathematical recursive function of the type considered by godel there was a tm that could compute its function by recasting the liar paradox in the form of a machine which would go into an infinite loop when fed the definition of another machine that would complete its computation and halt then on feeding a copy of the machine to itself it would halt if and only if it didnt his thesis provided the foundation for a host of subsequent efforts to reduce the concept of computation to its simplest elements and the phrase turingcomplete entered the textbooks a few years later turing raised the question can a machine think turing at that time there was no clear definition of what thinking actually is but then as now it was generally agreed that thinking is something that brains can do we might turn turings question around and ask instead can a brain compute in one sense this is a trivial question since the first computers were people they must be able to but since mathematicians have gone to so much trouble over the entscheidungsproblem we perhaps ought to enquire as to whether biological brains are turingcomplete if only for the sake of completeness mice have brains made out of neurons that communicate with each other via synapses the biochemistry of neurons and synapses is complex but their basic function is simple in essence the dendrites of a neuron receive chemical messages through their synapses which open ion channels which collectively create an electrical potential in the receiver which if it is enough to reach a certain threshold will induce a pulse spike of action potential in the axon of the receiver neuron successive excitations can lead to successive pulses we could think of the frequency of pulses along an axon as being the signal carried by it wilson cowan but for the present purposes it is more convenient to consider just the two extrema and in the diagrams below a neuron is abstractly depicted as an oval with a line its axon coming out of it axons have multiple terminals each of which can synapse with a different receiver neuron or with different dendrites of the same receiver an excitatory synapse is depicted as an arrowhead and an inhibitory one as a little circle assuming a potentiation threshold of in a receiver neuron we could construct an inverter from two synapses as shown here the upper input neuron supplies a constant pulse to an excitatory synapse and the lower one provides a variable signal a which could be either or to an inhibitory synapse if a the inhibitory synapse will cancel out the effect of the excitatory one and no pulse will be induced in the receiver neuron if a there will be no inhibitory effect and a pulse will be induced in the receiver either way the signal induced in the receiver is a the negation of a synapses could be configured to perform logical computations in various ways for example one way to construct an and function is to make both inputs excitatory and use a receiver potentiation threshold of another way to make an and function could be to have a third constant input to an inhibitory synapse and use a receiver potentiation threshold of the inhibitory synapse and potentiation threshold combine to prevent an impulse being induced in the receiver in every combination of input signals except when they are both any function of two bits can be computed by a composition of not and and functions shown here is one way to make a nand function and as previously mentioned any function of any number of bits can be constructed from just these basic building blocks hence we can conclude that any computable function can be computed by a neural network in principle of course in practice the functionality of a physical network is limited by its size the human brain contains about neurons a bees has and aplysia a sea slug manages to get along just fine with only chudler mice and sea slugs have brains but bacteria dont they dont have neurons and synapses they are a hundred times smaller than a single neuron it is tempting to imagine they are completely stupid incapable of anything remotely resembling computation but this image is false bacteria compute they navigate through chemical fields like sensible robots reacting sensibly to the smell of the chemical information that arrives at the receptors in their membranes and they can adapt as well bacteria subjected to high temperatures respond by manufacturing extra chaperone proteins mccallum and inniss which protect them against the stress of future strange encounters of the thermal kind a protein is a ribbon of up to different kinds of amino acid chained together that folds around into a particular shape by the attractive and repulsive electromagnetic forces of its constituent atoms protein folding can be adversely affected by heat chaperone proteins act to prevent misfolding in a new protein being formed just as this sentence is a string of letters and other symbols so a protein is a chemical message expressed by a string of amino acids the different amino acids are the different symbols of which protein messages are made proteins are manufactured by ribosomes to a prescription given to them in the form of ribonucleic acid rna the formula of all life as we know it rna is a chain polymer of different nucleotides adenine cytosine guanine and uracil better known by their initials a c g and u a triplet of nucleotides is called a codon because it encodes the prescription of a particular amino acid the encoding is unambiguous each triplet encodes one and only one amino acid but it is redundant in that there can be more than one code for a particular amino acid for example the sequences cau and cac both encode an amino acid called histidine there are possible permutations of four different things taken three at a time which encode the amino acids that occur in proteins how the code originated is still unknown but it probably evolved from simpler forms the eukaryotic cells genome is stored in chromosomes each of which is a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid dna a doublesided chain of pairedup nucleotides probably evolved from rna leon dna uses a methylated form of uracil called thymine t whereas uracil will happily bond to any of the other nucleotides t only bonds to pairs with a and c only pairs with g the pairing up the deoxygenation of its sugarphosphate backbone and the methylisation make dna hydrophobic and unresponsive to the attentions of most enzymes enabling it to serve as a long term memory for the information encoded by its sequence of nucleotides a change of temperature or some other cause such as the arrival of a molecule at its cell membrane prompts the genome to express a gene by transcribe the information content of the appropriate part of itself into rna called messenger rna or mrna for short containing the recipe of the protein it wants to be made there are two general types of gene in the human genome noncoding rna genes and proteincoding genes noncoding rna genes represent per cent of the total and encode functional rna molecules many of these rnas are involved in the control of gene expression particularly protein synthesis they have no overall conserved structure the job of translating mrna into a protein is performed by a ribosome which walks along the mrna message matching each codon nucleotide triple on it with a stock of aminocyltrna molecules made from the other strand of dna the matching process causes the amino acid to become divorced from its trna partner and married to the end of the polypeptide chain protein being assembled meanwhile the matching of trna and mrna doesnt result in a lasting marriage as the ribosome cuts them up into their constituent parts for recycling a ribosome is itself made of rna and protein hence a ribosome is also a string of symbols rather a long one made of million atoms lanl so a ribosome is a machine made of a string of symbols rna and protein that reads a string of nucleotide symbols mrna and writes a string of amino acid symbols a protein just like a turing machine shapiro realised that the basic operations of certain biomolecular machines within living cells recognition of molecular building blocks cleavage and ligation of biopolymer molecules and movement along a polymer could all be used in principle to construct a universal computer based on turings conceptual machine he has taken this idea along the road of practical application we have already succeeded in creating a biological automaton made of dna and proteins able to diagnose in a test tube the molecular symptoms of certain cancers and treat the disease by releasing a therapeutic molecule shapiro and benenson in theory a ribosomelike machine could be made to compute any function that a turing machine can that is any function at all that can be defined by any machine by any computer even the most powerful supercomputer in principle a ribosome computer could be made that could beat the world chess champion write stories as entrancing as harry potter compose symphonies and plot clever ways of making money on the stockmarket all at the same time but only in theory in practice what a ribosome can and cant compute is limited by its physical size but thats also true of brains the human brain has billion neurons each at least times bigger than a bacterium which is times bigger than a ribosome given all the remarkable computations just one ribosome can do just imagine what x x billion ribosomes could compute if they all worked together at first glance stromatolites and people appear to be very different things stromatolites prokaryote colonies are the oldest known form of life on earth dating back over billion years allwood et al whereas hominids are the newest eukaryote kids on the block of evolution who did not emerge as a distinct species until some billion years later kumar viewed from this perspective our most ancient hominid ancestor did fall out of her tree only yesterday despite the huge stretch of time from the birth of the stromatolites to our arrival on this planet we and they have one key thing in common our life recipes are encoded by the information content of deoxyribonucleic acid or dna packaged within the single chromosome of a prokarote bacterium and within the multiple chromosomes within the nucleus of every eukaryotic cell of our bodies left alone dna just sits there doing nothing the nucleotides of its twin spirals are pairbonded rendering the molecule inert and largely unresponsive to the attentions of other molecules passing by in this way it is able to function as a permanent memory that does not degrade even over millions of years although it can be damaged by mutagens such as oxidizing agents alkylating agents and highenergy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and xrays in human cells the different chromosomes occupy separate areas in the nucleus called chromosome territories steroid hormones cause changes within a cell by first passing through the cell membrane of the target cell steroid hormones unlike nonsteroid hormones can do this because they are fatsoluble cell membranes are composed of a phospholipid bilayer which prevents fatinsoluble molecules from diffusing into the cell once inside the cell the steroid hormone binds with a specific receptor found only in the cytoplasm of the target cell the receptor bound steroid hormone then travels into the nucleus and binds to another specific receptor on the chromatin once bound to the chromatin this steroid hormonereceptor complex calls for the production of messenger rna mrna molecules through a process called transcription the mrna molecules are then modified and transported to the cytoplasm the mrna molecules code for the production of proteins through a process called translation movie steroid hormones are derivatives of cholesterol and include products of the adrenal cortex ovaries and testes as well as the related molecule vitamin d unlike proteinpolypeptide hormones steroid hormones are not stored in large amounts when needed they are rapidly synthesized from cholesterol by a series of enzymatic reactions most of the cholesterol needed for rapid steroid hormone synthesis is stored intracellularly in the tissue of origin in response to appropriate signals the precursor is moved to organelles mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum where a series of enzymes eg isomerases dehydrogenases rapidly convert the molecule to the appropriate steroid hormone the identity of the final steroidal product is thus dictated by the set of enzymes expressed in that tissue mice are genetically closer to humans than you might imagine indeed practically every human gene appears to have a counterpart in the mouse genome human genome project if we imagine that the genes of the pairs of human chromosomes were reorganised into smaller blocks those pieces could be reassembled to produce a model of the mouse genome shown in figure because of the mousehuman genomic homology a gene on a human chromosome can often lead to a confident prediction of where a closely related gene will be found in the mouse and vice versa for example a crippling heritable muscle disorder in mice maps to a location on the mouse x chromosome that is closely analogous to the map location for the xlinked human duchenne muscular dystrophy gene these two similar diseases are caused by the mouse and human versions of the same gene the mouse and human genes produce proteins that function in very similar ways and that are clearly required for normal muscle development and function in the corresponding species likewise the discovery of a mouse gene associated with pigmentation reproduction and blood cell defects was the crucial key to uncovering the basis for a human disease known as the piebald trait owing to such close humanmouse relationships as these together with the benefits of transgenic technologies the mouse offers enormous potential in identifying new human genes deciphering their complex functions and even treating genetic diseases human genome project the eukaryote genome is represented in chromosomes which come in homologous pairs each member of the pair contains information on how to build the same protein products one member of each pair comes from the mother and one comes from the father humans have pairs of autosomal chromosomes and pair of sex chromosomes xx for females and xy chromosome for males the genotype of an individual is defined by what alleles an individual has at a locus of a chromosome the phenotype is the observable expression of the genotype for example the phenotype for a genotype with one a allele and one o allele at at the abo blood group locus would be blood type a there are approximately genetic loci on the pairs of chromosomes many loci are involved in specifying the form of a protein for example the locus of the beta gene for the haemoglobin molecule is near the tip of the short arm of chromosome and the locus of the alpha gene is near the tip of the short arm of chromosome similarly the expression of a character depends upon many loci in different chromosomes for example the blood group locus is on chromosome whereas the rhesus rh locus in on chromosome blood type is a function of both factors prokaryotes reproduce by fission transformation and transduction during binary fission the single dna molecule replicates and both copies attach to the cell membrane the cell membrane begins to grow between the two dna molecules once the bacterium has doubled in size its cell membrane begins to pinch inward a cell wall then forms between the two dna molecules dividing the original cell into two identical daughter cells a bacterium reproduces by fission its single chromosome replicates and both copies attach to the cell membrane the cell membrane then begins to grow between the two genomes once the bacterium has doubled in size its cell membrane begins to pinch inward a cell wall then forms between the two chromosomes dividing the original cell into two identical daughter cells in conjugation one bacterium connects itself to another through a protein tube structure called a pilus genes are transferred from one bacterium to the other through this tube bacteria are able to laterally transfer plasmid genes by conjugation in which one bacterium connects itself to another through a protein tube structure called a pilus through which plasmids are transferred some bacteria are capable of taking up dna from their environment these dna remnants most commonly come from dead bacterial cells during transformation the bacterium binds the dna and transports it across the bacterial cell membrane the new dna is then incorporated into the bacterial cells dna transduction is a type of recombination that involves the exchanging of bacterial dna through bacteriophages viruses that infect bacteria once a bacteriophage attaches to a bacterium it inserts its genome into the bacterium the viral genome enzymes and other components are then replicated and assembled within the host bacterium the newly formed bacteriophages then lyse split open the bacterium releasing the new viruses during the assembly process some of the hosts bacterial dna may become encased in the viral capsid instead of the viral genome when this bacteriophage infects another bacterium it injects the dna fragment from the previous bacterium this dna fragment then becomes inserted into the dna of the new bacterium this type of transduction is called generalized transduction in specialized transduction fragments of the host bacteriums dna become incorporated into the viral genomes of the new bacteriophages the dna fragments can then be transfered to any new bacteria that these bacteriophages infect homeotic genes homeotic genes govern the development of bodies nssleinvolhard and wieschaus identified and classified genes of key importance in determining the body plan and the formation of body segments of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster embryonic development is controlled by three functional groups of homeotic genes gapgenes lay the foundations of a rough body plan along the headtotail axis pair rulegenes govern formation of every second body segment segment polaritygenes refine the headtotail polarity of each individual segment meaning that the headend and the tailend of a segment look different the homeotic genes of the fly are homologous to homeotic genes in other vertebrates including man it is actually possible to transfer a homeotic gene from man to the embryo of a fruit fly where it is can perform some of the functions that the corresponding drosophila gene normally executes in humans a common genetic variation in the promotor region of the serotonin transporter the sertlong and short allele httlpr has been shown to affect the development of several regions of the thalamus in adults people who inherit two short alleles sertss have more neurons and a larger volume in the pulvinar and possibly the limbic regions of the thalamus enlargement of the thalamus provides an anatomical basis for why people who inherit two sertss alleles are more vulnerable to major depression posttraumatic stress disorder and suicide psychosomasis the brain encodes a mathematical model of whats going on in the world around it and whats going on in the world of the body it lives in this model is physically organised into three subsystems the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain each of which performs a particular class of function it is likely that these major divisions layered one on top of another are evolutionary developments mcclean the hindbrain shared with reptiles consists of the structures of the brain stem medulla pons cerebellum mesencephalon globus pallidus and the olfactory bulbs the oldest of the three it controls the basic mechanisms for staying alive bodys vital functions such as heart rate breathing body temperature and balance the midbrain or limbic system comprising the hippocampus amygdala and hypothalamus is found in mammals it is responsible for what are called emotions in human beings and is the seat of the value judgments that we make often unconsciously that exert such a strong influence on our behaviour the forebrain or cortex is the site of language rationality imagination and selfawareness the cortex is divided into left and right hemispheres connected by the nerve fibres of the corpus calosum the left half of the cortex controls the right side of the body and the right side of the brain the left side of the body the right brain is more spatial abstract musical and artistic while the left brain more linear rational and verbal although either side can assume the functions of the other in someone who has had a hemispherectomy the ache in the heart the knot in the stomach the tingling in the loins the shine in the eye the shiver of excitement these somatic sensations are the brains perceptions of what is going on in the body based on signals sent to it along the affector neural highways of the spinal cord at the core of the brainstem reticular formation nuclei receive input from the bodys sensory systems and other parts of the brain such as the cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres and route them to the thalamus the ascending reticular activating system ras pathway originates from a group of neurons around the fourth ventricle in the rostral pons near midbrain most of these neurons are acetylcholinergic and project to the thalamus controlling whether the gate is open or closed the key is in the action of acetylcholine acetylcholine cannot by itself activate or shut down the neurons of the thalamus instead it sensitizes them by slightly depolarizing the thalamic neurons it does this by closing a hyperpolarizing potassium channel the ascending system can make the thalamus more sensitive to sensory input this situation would correspond to an awake alert state the ras is vital to learning selfcontrol inhibition attention and motivation when functioning normally it provides the neural connections that are needed for the processing and learning of information and the ability to pay attention to the correct task the frontal lobes help us to pay attention to tasks focus concentration make good decisions plan ahead learn and remember what we have learned glutamate pathways from the prefrontal cortex to other areas of the brain are mediated by dopamine and norepinephrine it has been said that of the brain is there to inhibit the other the inhibitory mechanisms of the cortex keep us from being hyperactive from saying things out of turn and from getting mad at inappropriate times ras norepinephrine deficiency is correlated with the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd whose subjects show more theta and alpha brainwave activity indicating a lack of control in the cortex of the brain subjects exhibit the symptoms such as impulsive behaviors quick temper poor decision making and hyperactivity an abnormally high level of synchronized discharge of large numbers of neurons creates a condition known as epilepsy which manifests as jerking movements andor loss of awareness petit mal or can be more intense resulting in convulsions and loss of consciousness grand mal the hippocampus has the lowest seizure threshold of all cortical regions and a loss of neurons in the hippocampus is commonly seen with epileptics information about the external environment perceived by all the senses with the significant exception of the olfactory system is routed from the ras to the cortex via the thalamus perched on top of the brainstem the thalamus also receives signals from the cortical sites to which it relays information which suggests it performs some filtering or preprocessing of new data based on what is already being perceived projections from the solitary tract nucleus to the limbic system hypothalamus insula and amygdala are believed to account for the behavioural relation between tastes and emotions

frequently prescribed for anxiety disorders such as social anxiety panic disorders obsessivecompulsive disorder eating disorders chronic pain and occasionally for posttraumatic stress disorder irritable bowel syndrome lichen simplex chronicus and premature ejaculation but preventing reuptake also floods the presynaptic neurons autoreceptors which provide it with feedback the neuron adapts gradually to heightened feedback by reducing the sensitivity of the autoreceptors which in turn reduces presynaptic serotonin production and hence creates an addiction to the ssri ssris have also been shown to reduce fetal growth in studies with mice and rats gillum et al found that a chemical messenger called nacylphosphatidylethanolamine nape is made in the small intestine after the animals ate a greasy meal nape crosses the bloodbrain barrier and becomes concentrated in the hypothalamus a specific region of the brain that governs hunger rats treated with extra nape for five days ate less and lost weight hinting that studying nape could help researchers design better appetite suppressants or obesity drugs beauregard studied magnetic resonance images of the brain activity of people experiencing emotions and concluded that conscious and unconscious mental processesevents which are neurally grounded are selectively translated based on a specific code into neural processesevents at the various levels of brain organization biophysical molecular chemical neural circuits in turn the resulting neural processesevents are translated into processes and events in other physiological systems such as the immune or endocrine system other neurons monitor what goes on in the body creating a feedback system the feel of a feeling is a combination of the cognitive reaction to an initial perception and the perception of the significance of somatic feedback signals in the case of phantom limbs the afferent neurons that were connected to the limb form new endpoints in the stump and that those endpoints sense stimuli and transmit them to the brain which thinks the signals are still coming from the now nonexistent limb one experimenter found that stimulating various areas of the face made a limbless patient imaginine that her phantom fingers were moving her cortical neurons that used to process limb information had joined up with nearby afferent neurons experiments growing neurons on top of silicon chips found that growing neurons seek out electromagnetic activity to join up with so in an amputees brain when neurons that used to be turned on by limb effectors are no longer stimulated because the limb has gone they turn to other neighbours to get some actiona kind of unguided learning causes of animal behavior in humans the reproductive instinct manifests itself at the conscious level by the emotions we call desire and love but what are desire and love and how do they arise this deceptively simple question does not have a simple answer based on his studies of a freshwater fish called the threespined stickleback tinbergen discovered the fundamental causes of animal behaviours diagrammed here all behaviours including physical movements dilation of pupils and vibrations of the vocal chords producing sounds are the external outputs of a complex cascade of computations between cells of the body the configuration of cells and signalling mechanisms of an animal derives from its ontogeny growth which at its heart is a process of cell division dictated by the instructions expressed by the animals genome in the context of proximate influences what we call feelings are the brains perceptions of the bodys chain of reactions to external or internal stimuli for example oxytocin levels are elevated when one is feeling love but the feeling of love itself is somatosensory love and unrequited love are psychosomatic states poets wax lyrical about the pain of a broken heart this metaphor may reflect real events in the mammalian brain areas that are activated during the distress caused by social exclusion are also those activated during physical pain panksepp studies of people experiencing emotions have found correlations between the kind of emotion being felt and the concentration of certain hormones in the bloodstream which is the chemical communications network of the endocrine system as well as being the pathway for carrying nutrients and waste products to and from cells for example excitement is correlated with adrenaline levels and feelings of love are correlated with oxytocin levels adrenaline secreted by the adrenal gland signals liver cells to synthesise glucose and release it into the bloodstream for delivery to cells throughout the body which use it as an energy source for their metabolic reactions oxytocin is made in the hypothalamus and has a wide variety of physical effects associated with bonding and trust behaviours in the peripheral nervous system acetylcholine activates muscles and is a major neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system when acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors on skeletal muscle fibers it opens ligand gated sodium channels in the cell membrane sodium ions then enter the muscle cell stimulating muscle contraction acetylcholine while inducing contraction of skeletal muscles instead inhibits contraction in cardiac muscle fibers this distinction is attributed to differences in receptor structure between skeletal and cardiac fibers in the brain acetylcholine pathways form the cholinergic system which extends from the brainstem and basal forebrain to the midbrain and cortex it is involved in the regulation of memory and learning it is this system that degenerates in alzheimers disease acetylcholine has been shown to enhance the amplitude of synaptic potentials following longterm potentiation in many regions including the dentate gyrus ca piriform cortex and neocortex it is also involved in arousal and reward ach has an important role in the enhancement of sensory perceptions when we wake up and in sustaining attention there are two main classes of acetylcholine receptor achr nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nachr and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors machr named for the ligands used to activate the receptors nicotinic achrs are ionotropic receptors permeable to sodium potassium and chloride ions they are stimulated by nicotine and acetylcholine they are of two main types muscle type and neuronal type the former can be selectively blocked by curare and the latter by hexamethonium the main location of nicotinic achrs is on muscle end plates autonomic ganglia both sympathetic and parasympathetic and in the cns although nicotine can interact with a variety of receptor at numerous tissues it is its interaction with specific receptors in the brain that creates the dependence associated with smoking within the midbrain nicotine interacts with the alpha beta nicotinic acetylcholine receptor acetylcholine is the natural ligand for this receptors however nicotine also an acetylcholine receptor agonist has a higher affinity for the alpha beta receptors located on postsynaptic neurons these receptors are comprised by two and three subunits that form a channel for transporting ions through the membrane when two molecules of nicotine or another ligand engage binding sites within the ionotropic receptor the ion channel is activated looking into the receptor we see that it is closed but activation by ligand triggers channel opening for the passage of calcium sodium and potassium ionsthis generates action potentials to the reward area of the brain here the impulse stimulates the release of neurotransmitters including dopamine dopamine triggers additional signaling events that stimulate the reward circuit generating short feelings of wellbeing increased attention and improved mood every time tobacco is used dopamine levels surge however nicotine is eliminated rather rapidly causing dopamine levels to decline the result a craving for more nicotine with continued use alpha beta nicotinic receptors undergo complex adaptive changes including up regulation and desensitization over time these and other downstream changes contribute to a stronger need for nicotine stimulation to achieve the rewards of smoking httppharmamotioncomarvideomolecularmechanismnicotineaddiction behavioral scientists have explored the biological roots of love as well as the psychological factors that determine love feelings and behaviors the action of neurotransmitters has been linked to major thinking and emotional disorders many medications used to treat conditions such as depression or schizophrenia act at the synapse on these chemicals the indications are that the broad actions of specific neurotransmitters are involved in feelings and thoughts of love dopamine is thought to increase attention motivation and goal directed behavior in excess it can produce feelings of exhilaration increased energy hyperactivity sleeplessness loss of appetite symptoms of addiction anxiety and fear to the extent that the feeling of ecstasy in romantic love involves these symptoms it may be the result of dopamine norepinephrine can also cause exhilaration excessive energy and loss of appetite serotonin has been associated with depression when levels at the synapse are too low some antidepression medications such as prozac work to increase the level of serotonin at the synapses decreased levels of serotonin also have been linked to obsessivecompulsive disorder lovers often become obsessed in thinking about their loved one they cannot turn off their racing thoughts while chemical action in love presents an appealing hypothesis it remains unproven the anatomy of love rests in nerve centers in the brain these connect with the limbic system controlling motivation and emotion the brains pain and pleasure centers are also part of this complex neurological mechanism these centers are responsible for sexual drive and feelings another important role in the love process may be played by endorphins chemicals produced by the brain similar to morphine that increase feelings of pleasure and reduce pain other brain chemicals similar to amphetamines are thought to control the high experience when we are in love and the crash when love fails helen fisher at stony brook university studied people who had just fallen madly in love the subjects were shown photographs of their loved ones as well as love letters music tapes and colognes that reminded them of the person they loved the subjects completed questionnaires and turned a dial to indicate the strength of their romantic feelings these were compared with their reactions to photographs of other persons their reactions confirmed that photos and other objects could elicit feelings of passion objects unrelated to their love partner did not arouse such feelings mri scans were made of the subjects under lovedone stimulus and nonstimuls situations many brain areas became active as the lovestruck subjects viewed photographs of their loved one two brain regions were predominant the first was the caudate nucleus a cshaped area near the center of the brain that is part of the most primitive areas of the brain this area has been found to be part of the reward mechanism of the brain it is necessary for detecting and discriminating among rewards and providing sensations of pleasure it produces motivation and movements to obtain preferred rewards the more passionate the subject felt the greater the activity of the caudate nucleus a second active area is called the ventral tegmental area vta it is also an important part of the reward circuitry of the brain more important it is the center for dopaminemaking cells from this area nerve fibers distribute dopamine to many other brain areas dopamine is responsible for feelings of euphoria while many other areas may also be active fishers findings highlight the importance of brain networks and brain chemistry in generating feelings of romantic love serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid ltryptophan by a short metabolic pathway

to the ssri ssris have also been shown to reduce fetal growth mentality our memories are associative one thing leads to another and one thought leads to another without associations we wouldnt enjoy flowing thoughts or dialogue we wouldnt be reminded of things experience is a great teacher feedback of the consequences of an action in a given situation modifies existing belief structures and creates a new behaviour when faced with the same situation again being able to learn from experience is one of the signs of intelligence our understanding of the world and of ourselves is a consequence of personal experience that experience includes subjective observation and the absorption of beliefs transmitted to us through various media such as conversation written texts television and so forth belief formation is a learning process and beliefs once formed become memories in the brain memories are expressed by configurations of neural networks when we remember an experience our brains make physical changes to networks shortterm forms of memory are expressed as alterations in the effectiveness of preexisting connections the longterm form often is associated with the growth of new synaptic connections hawkins et physical changes create a functional change in the operational rules implemented by neurons and their synapses the rules express how information is interpreted which in turn determines which actions such as muscle movements are undertaken thereby creating behaviours rules are derived from contingencies which specify discriminative stimuli responses and consequences skinner the limbic system is responsible for things like emotions instinctsbasic drives motivation mood pleasurepain smell and memory the hippocampus so named because in section its shape reminded early anatomists of a seahorse is believed to mediate the construction of episodic and spatial memory which enables you to play the scene back by reactivating memories formed in the cortex it is well known that experiences which involve an emotional response are more memorable it could be that the hippocampus is activated by emotions and functions as a gatekeeper which decides whether shortterm cortical memories should be reinforced to turn them into longterm ones the hippocampus receives modulatory input from the serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine systems the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus and cholinergic and gabaergic signals from the medial septal area the entorhinal cortex serves as the main interface between the hippocampus and other parts of the brain within the hippocampus the flow of information is largely unidirectional as shown in figure the hippocampus shows two modes of activity theta rhythm characterised by regular waves appears during active behavior and rem dreaming sleep during nonrem sleep and when an animal is resting or otherwise not engaged with its surroundings the hippocampus shows a pattern of irregular slow waves occasionally interrupted by large surges called sharp waves wilson and mcnaughton found that when hippocampal place cells have overlapping spatial firing fields and therefore often fire in nearsimultaneity they tend to show correlated activity during sleep following the behavioral session the twostage memory theory buzski proposes that memories are stored within the hippocampus during behavior and then later transferred to the neocortex during sleep however it is also possible that memories are formed within the cortex and that hippocampus acts as a memory reinforcer through its sharp waves procedural memory such as knowing how to ride a bike does not appear to involve the hippocampus but appears to be associated with modifications in the cerebellum the basal ganglia and the motor cortex all of which are involved in motor control dubuc little ecoli squirming her way through her world of chemical fields doesnt have a brain of neural networks but she does have a memory one inherited from her mother who died in the act of producing twin daughters made of her own body and materials she had made from the food she had eaten during her minute lifetime her daughters knowledge of which chemicals are good to eat and which are not is stored in her genome the magic recipe of life which tells her how to make all her body parts including those involved in the processing of signals from the external environment and the genome also tells her how and when to make daughters of her own with their own membranes and receptors and transducers she will pass this knowledge on to them the same way her mother taught her by providing each of them with her genome the genome is the master memory of a bacterium responsible for building all of its apparatus daughters of bacteria are as identical as identical twins can be but they are not exactly identical the variability in genome content among closely related strains of prokaryotes has been one of the most remarkable discoveries of genomics cuadrosorellana et al it used to be thought that variation arises as a result of random mutations during reproduction but nature is not random to every thing there is a reason some diseases and deformities of bacteria arise from imperfect cloning during reproduction but this is caused by environmental conditions and perhaps flaws in their genomes others occur because different mothers have different learning experiences some of which can change their genomes specialized enzymes under regulatory control can remove dna segments move segments from one site to another reverse a segments orientation or insert foreign segments mcadams and arkin this could explain how successive generations of bacteria learn to defend themselves against antibiotics far from being sheer luck through random mutation it is the consequence of some mothers being able to develop protection mechanisms and passing this ability on to their daughters through an altered genome populations of bacteria and viruses undergo genetic drift as the descendants of individuals which have learned to defend themselves against antigens manufactured by eukaryotic immune systems and medical laboratories survive these onslaughts and come to dominate the population making decisions one evening or so the story goes a stressedout business executive comes home you look tired darling says his wife would you like a cup of tea for heavens sake explodes the executive do i have to make all the decisions around here to tea or not to tea that is the question back in xx jeremy bentham pondered this kind of issue and proposed a principle that has since come to be called utility theory his idea was that the expected net value utility of the outcomes of each alternative to the decision maker could be measured or calculated and compared arithmetically the one with the greatest utility becoming the preferred choice this general approach became the foundation of operations research let ut be the calculated utility of having tea and let un be the calculated utility of not having tea then if ut un the choice is tea the function calculated by an axon hillock lends itself readily to this kind of arithmetic judgement in the example suppose that the utilities can somehow be calculated and transmitted along two neurons t and n neuron t makes an excitatory synapse with neuron d and neuron n an inhibitory one an impulse will be induced in d if the degree of excitation from t sufficiently exceeds the degree of inhibition from n to reach the potentiation threshold of d only our ability to learn and change our minds protects us from living in the darkness of prejudice however one of the mysteries of human nature is how organisms that are built to learn can stubbornly refuse to do so and cling on to beliefs that fly in the face of all the available evidence or continue behaviours like smoking that provide shortterm gratification at the expense of foreseeable longterm demise the same kind of phenomenon is observable in peoples rationally inconsistent decisions about timeshifted alternatives gilbert one possible reason may be that the conscious reasoning mind is not the one in control but is merely an advisor to an emotionridden subonsciousness what freud calls the ego what is consciousness the leastwell scientifically understood biological phenomenon it is the one subject on which nonscientists have the fewest doubts they just know it is something they have and most are equally convinced that it is something unique to humans as convinced as religious adherents of the th century were that humans were qualitatively different from all other creatures even when darwin came along and suggested otherwise the very same egocentrism that led men to believe they were closer to god than the beasts of the field drives people these days to assert unequivocally that whereas computers might be able to beat them at chess and translate languages better than they and calculate faster than they computing artifacts could never reach the mystical heights of selfawareness simply because they cannot possibly imagine how such a thing could be possible but such a mindset is anthropocentrism in its purest form we can take a different view however different views can take a long time to become accepted in the face of opposition from individual egos and social forces for example around bc pythogoreans deduced from the regularity of day and night that the earth orbited a fire we dont know whether they realised this fire was the same sun they saw rising at dawn and setting at dusk their theory was hotly contested by plato and his followers who were devout geocentrists such was their social dominance even when years later aristarchus perhaps having seen an eclipse formulated the first mathematical theory of heliocentrism he was dismissed to obscurity as a crank another years after that the empire of rome arose and institutionalised geocentricity as a religious dogma that ostracised science right up to the time of galileo years later but in the last years or so science has steadily gained greater social respectability and it may not require another years before the currently ubiquitous belief that man is something more than merely an intelligent plastic machine is itself consigned to the history of myth like many mysteries consciousness might best be understood by approaching it from a lateralthinking direction by considering its counterparts unconscious and subconscious thought unfortunately american language does not discriminate the two a good punch on the head can make a boxer fall to the floor incapable of voluntary musular control he can neither hear nor see does not respond to touch although his heart keeps beating and his electroencephalogram eeg doesnt flatline hes not dead hes been knocked out hes unconscious an electric current travelling through a wire produces an electromagnetic field around it so does an electric potential travelling down an axon the eeg is an image of the changing electromagnetic radiation produced by neurons which is picked up by scalp electrodes with increasing levels of anesthesia the eeg shows more regularity and frequencies are decreased jordan et al brain rhythms delta hz delta wave activity occurs most frequently during stage n slowwave sleep accounting for or more of the eeg record during this stage these waves are believed to originate in the thalamus in coordination with the reticular formation theta hz in rats hippocampal theta is seen when an animal is active or fearful and during rem sleep in humans cortical theta appears during drowsy meditative or sleeping states but not during the deepest stages of sleep it is commonly argued that cholergic receptors do not respond rapidly enough to be involved in generating theta waves and therefore that gabaergic signals must play the central role alpha hz alpha waves originate from the occipital lobe during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes alpha waves are reduced with open eyes and drowsiness and sleep they are thought to represent the activity of the visual cortex in an idle state beta hz low amplitude beta waves with multiple and varying frequencies are often associated with active busy or anxious thinking and active concentration over the motor cortex bursts of beta activity are associated with motor control and reduced when there is movement change beta activity is increased when movement has to be resisted or voluntarily suppressed gamma hz gamma waves are observed as neural synchrony from visual cues in both conscious and subliminal stimuli this research also sheds light on how neural synchrony may explain stochastic resonance in the nervous system they are also implicated in rapidrem sleep which involves visualizations and also during anesthesia the brain creates a model of the world around it thats how we navigate how we avoid obstacles and why we refrain from trying to walk through walls the brain also creates a model of the body it inhabits it can sense the hearts beat the stomachs ache the muscles cramp the flushs heat the very same mechanisms that create the brains model of the body can be applied to enable it to create a model of itself and recursively a model of its model of itself and so on a single cubic millimeter of cortex the spatial resolution of current fmri technology contains an astounding array of energy regulating equipment pyramidal neurons glial cells billion synapses and metres of axons pakkenberg et al emergent intelligence the combined effects of simple operations can produce complex behaviours figure shows three of the rules that make up the logic of a virtual spider krink and vollrath that creates a virtual web similar to a garden spider these rules control the building of the capture spiral cs each rule consists of a precondition upper box and an action lower box the directions of the arrows represent the activity flow each rule activation and execution starts with a query to the sensory system grey arrows and results in the execution of a behaviour pattern that performs a conditional activity loop black arrows the first rule directs the spider along the auxiliary spiral as with its inner leg il to the next crossing with a radius afterwards the second rule makes the spider search for outer frame threads and previously constructed cs threads with its outer leg ol when the spider finally grasps a thread or stretches its outer leg entirely it attaches a new cs thread on the previously detected radius the location of the new attachment point is determined by a compromise between the previous distance between the as and the last cs turn as well as the spiders anticipated mesh size of the cs it takes an orb weaver spider about to minutes to make its web the process of making a web starts with an initial adhesive silk thread extruded from the silk spinning organs spinnerets air currents are used to waft the thread across a gap in the foliage to entangle in leaves or twigs on the other side when it sticks to a surface the spider will carefully walk over the thread and strengthen it with a second thread for added strength the spider moves back and forth across this bridge line strengthening it by laying down more silk it then drops from the bridge lines centre to attach a vertical line to the ground this provides the basic y shaped framework to which are then added supporting outer framelines and the radial lines the spokes on which the spiral lines are laid a nonsticky temporary spiral line is laid down first starting from the centre and running outwards this temporary spiral gives the spider a scaffolding from which it then lays down the more closely spaced permanent sticky spiral starting from the periphery toward the centre or hub the spaces between each spiral are proportional to the distance from the tip of its back legs to its spinners the spider removes and rolls up the temporary spiral as it lays down the sticky spiral the excess silk is eaten and recycled emergent behaviours are displayed by many species colonies of ants mounds built by termites swarms of bees schools of fish flocks of birds and herds of mammals individually ants arent particularly clever but collectively a colony of ants can solve complex problems such as finding the shortest path to the best food source or allocating workers to different tasks swarm intelligence emerges from collective decisionmaking and communication in an ant colony noones in charge no generals command ant warriors no managers boss ant workers the queen plays no administrative role except to lay eggs yet even with half a million members an ant colony functions just fine without hierarchical management it relies instead upon countless interactions between individual ants each of which is following simple rules of thumb reacting by its innate programming to local stimuli in the form of chemical scents from larvae other ants intruders food and waste as it moves it leaves behind a chemical trail which provides information to other ants using distributed decision making and chemical communication ant colonies exhibit complex behaviors consider the problem of task allocation how many workers should go out foraging for food the number can change depending on conditions ants communicate by touch and smell when one ant bumps into another it sniffs with its antennae to find out if the other belongs to the same nest and where it has been working ants that have been outside smell different from those that have stayed inside before they leave the nest each day foragers normally wait for early morning patrollers to return as patrollers enter the nest they touch antennae briefly with foragers after a forager has contact with a several patrollers in a short space of time it will go out and follow the scent trails laid by the patrollers once ants start foraging and bringing back food other ants join the effort depending on the rate at which they encounter returning foragers a forager wont come back until it finds something the less food there is the longer it takes the forager to find it and get back the more food there is the faster it comes back thus effectively the colony decides whether its a good day to forage but no single individual is managing the process thats how swarm intelligence works simple creatures following simple rules each one acting on local information no ant sees the big picture no ant tells any other ant what to do the impressive capabilities of heterarchical organisations has inspired the development of artificial swarm intelligence systems made up of a population of simple agents interacting locally with one another and with their environment the technique has been applied to packet routing in telecommunication networks dorigo and sttzl software ants simulation agents collectively converge upon an optimal solution as they move through a simulated parameter space the ants record their positions and the quality of their solutions so that in later iterations more agents locate better solutions in nature many species travel in large numbers thats because as members of a big group whether its a flock school or herd individuals increase their chances of detecting predators finding food locating a mate or following a migration route for these animals coordinating their movements with one another can be a matter of life or death its much harder for a predator to avoid being spotted by a thousand fish than it is to avoid being spotted by one news that a predator is approaching spreads quickly through a school because fish sense from their neighbors that somethings going on when a predator strikes a school of fish the group is capable of scattering in patterns that make it almost impossible to track any individual it might explode in a flash create a kind of moving bubble around the predator or fracture into multiple blobs before coming back together and swimming away google uses swarm intelligence in its search engine when you type in a search query google surveys billions of web pages on its index servers to identify the most relevant ones it then ranks them by the number of pages that link to them counting links as votes the most popular sites get weighted votes since theyre more likely to be reliable the pages that receive the most votes are listed first in the search results in this way google uses the collective intelligence of the web to determine a pages importance wikipedia has also proved to be a big success with millions of articles in more than languages about everything under the sun each of which can be contributed by anyone or edited by anyone its now possible for huge numbers of people to think together in ways we never imagined a few decades ago no single person knows everything thats needed to deal with problems we face as a society such as health care or climate change but our collective knowledge is quite extensive for a group to be be intelligent whether its made up of ants or attorneys it needs each and all its members to do their individual jobs think about a honeybee as she walks around inside the hive if a cold wind hits the hive shell shiver to generate heat and in the process help to warm the nearby brood she has no idea that hundreds of workers in other parts of the hive are doing the same thing at the same time to the benefit of the next generation none of us knows what society as a whole needs but we could look around and say oh they need someone to volunteer at school or mow a communal lawn or help in a political campaign if youre looking for a role model in a world of complexity you could do worse than to imitate a bee miller social and political groups are swarms during mass protests in seattle antiglobalization activists used mobile communications devices to spread news quickly about police movements turning an otherwise unruly crowd into a smart mob that was able to disperse and reform like a school of fish the collective power of swarms is not news religious and political elites have known it for millenia and devote most of their time and effort to propoganda to program the swarm once programmed swarm members rally to the cause even to the extent of martyring themselves for the sake of what they have been conditioned to believe is an moral obligation greater than their personal survival the collective intelligence of a web of neurons emerges from the interactions of its individuals the timelapse series of brain images in figure taken from ms to ms after the single touch of a single whisker shows the spreading flame of thought in a rats brain but what are thoughts one thing is for sure they are not simple reflexes like those of the the big picture if this book ever manages to evolve into a coherent document this chapter will have moved to the beginning rather than the end as it is still here that state of perfection has not yet been reached no scientist worth his denarius would claim to know everything and no scientist worthy of the name would claim to know anything for sure there is just so much to know about even the tiniest of details does plus always equal how about one quark plus one quarkone graviton plus one graviton it surely needs more than one head to contain all that knowledge the preceding chapters are an attempt to reliably report on the findings of science so far all their statements are corroborated by cited experimental evidence this chapter is different it addresses open questions questions that have not yet been resolved and in some cases not even raised its hypotheses are intended as food for thought for the next generation of scientists to explore and shed more light on the miracles of life and existence although because of the nature of written communication and the limitation of having only two spatial dimensions plus hyperlinks to work with this chapter is organised into sections but they are not conceptually separate topics they are all intrictately interrelated some of the phenomena and their interrelationships will be mentioned the rest the majority it must be admitted are for you to find out whos in charge in feudal societies the king or lord is the chief executive officer of the population in ant colonies the queen is a humble servant of the brood most humanengineered systems are hierarchical the principle of divide and conquer was successfully deployed by caesar for building his empire by polya ref for solving mathematical problems and by von newman ref for designing the architecture of the artificial computer an architecture that remains the blueprint of todays technology but whos in charge of the human is it the mind or the body more to come the mathematics of beauty from the earliest days to the present mathematicians have been obsessed by the beauty of simplicity the perfection of the straight line the circle the dot the equation we delight in einstens famous equation relating mass and energy its so elegantly simple it must be right as far as we know but why you might wonder do they have this obsession is there some underlying cause many people would argue that it is selfevident but selfevidence is a substitute for a rational argument it really means i dont know go ask your mother more to come why do children ask why entrepreneurs engineers and people struggling to make ends meet are largely unconcerned about why as they are too preoccupied trying to figure out how but for children and adults beset by a tragedy and the odd philosopher most philosophers are a bit odd the question why always raises itself in their minds why is the sky blue why do girls like pink things why do i have to go to bed why cant i do whatever it it is that is being denied them why do clapping hands make noise does a tree falling in the forest make a sound if noones there to hear it why bring that up why is the ultimate academic question but that doesnt mean it is of no practical value on the contrary it is essential for survival knowledge is not power only knowledge of the tricks and techniques of persuasion is power but it is necessary for being able to build a causal model of how the world works one that is sufficiently accurate as to be able to survive in it bacteria manage to get along just fine without causal models as a population but not as individuals their machinery of life is highly adaptive as indeed is the machinery of viruses which can evolve faster that antibioticians can catch up with them like achilles the antibiotician only manages to reduce the difference bween himself and where the tortoisepaced virus was last time he saw it but by the time he gets there the virus has moved on yet a given individual bacterium is as helpless as a newborn babe and a newborn babe is almost as helpless as a bacterium it has the equipment for its cells to respire but beyond being programmed to seek what it thinks is its mothers nipple it doesnt know how to get the food its cells need to respire more to come references
